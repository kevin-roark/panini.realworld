audio / video for panini di parma
Projector idea
-web cam above projector, basically like a mirror
-how can we alter what we project?
	-possibly cool at some points to project exactly what camera sees?
	-project something on backs of people sitting on steps?
	-servo motors controlling mirrors in front of the projector
	-pockets of light to specific parts of the frame
		-warm toned/transient
			-changing between warm tones, can see webcam feed fading with white
			-obscure the image with not static but warmth, heavenly glow
-can try out different effects in room (any room)
-conceptually cleaner to have audio and video separate 

-warm distortion pockets, static blurring part of the image
	-extent to which this occurs function of general level of movement/activity
	-number of bodies we count/light sensor

-color gradient separation/distortion

-choose blocks of image and swap their places

-2 or three ideas like above, positive warm ways of manipulating image that go with general aesthetic/them without being violent war, have those all be a function of how much activity there is
	-degree of distortion is responsive

-mirrors would open up space, but hard to follow thru with

-projection wont reach edges of steps/mirror
	-changes way we need to think about the projection

several projectors several cameras, overlapping in some places

-need to make sure projection is the same size as what the webcam picks up

-would need to keystone the projector (smallens the image a bit)

-projector high enough that it hits the flat area of the stairs
	-keystone the image
	-could do along the top of steps, shadows would effect it a lot
	-or high up, shadows would have less of an effect



Sound idea
-vocoded sound mirror is nice already
-where would the speakers be?
	-how loud?
		-everyone within the mirrors could hear it or just in certain places
	-visible?
-what would modify the pitch of the vocoder?
-two mics, opposite sides of the mirrors, or steps
	-could get pretty bad feedback
-generally could get very bad feedback, need to reduce effect of speakers on microphone
-microphone in middle of steps, speakers by alma?
-need to buy ambient micâ€¦ $$$


GENERAL:
all electronics not very visible
	-blanket?
	-box? painted box?
-edible mirrors?
